# Convertidor_de_moneda

In this Repo I'll develop the second [challenge](https://www.aluracursos.com/challenges/oracle-one-back-end/conversordemoneda/sprint01) from [Oracle Next education](https://www.oracle.com/lad/education/oracle-next-education/)
basically this project is a money converter from Colombian pesos to the next currencies
  - DÃ³lar
  - Euros
  - Sterling pound
  - Japanese Yen
  -  Won sul-Korean

in order to do this more exciting I'm going to use the next API [https://currencyapi.com/docs](currencyapi)
to get the most recent value from the different currencies.

In addition as an extramile this project includes another converter, Binary to Decimal 

## Tecnologies

The project has been made with

- Java with the JDK 11 
- Swing for the graphic interphase
- the currency API mentioned before
- Gson for handle the API answer

---

## How to use it?

This is pretty easy to use, just execute the main file or if you are using the jar just execute it (Keep in mind that you will need to use the JDK 11), then you will see a dialog that will ask you 

wich converter use? (Binary or currency)

##### Binary
The first parte will ask u the way to converte Binary to decimal or vice-versa, then the system will ask u to enter the number in the choosen election(decimal or binary) then you will see the conversion result, finally another dialog to return at the begining or close the program

##### Currency
First the system will ask you the amount to convert then the currency and finally the value also will ask you to return to the main menu, enter another amount or exit

and yeap thi is pretty much all
